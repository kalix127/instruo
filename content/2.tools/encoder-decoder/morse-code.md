## What is the Text to Morse Code Tool?

The **Text to Morse Code Tool** allows users to seamlessly encode plain text into Morse code or decode Morse code back into plain text. Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as sequences of dots (`.`) and dashes (`-`), making it suitable for various applications.

## Features

- **Text to Morse Code**: Converts plain text into Morse code sequences.
- **Morse Code to Text**: Decodes Morse code back into human-readable text.
- **Error Handling**: Ignores unsupported characters and provides clean outputs.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Easily copy the encoded or decoded output for further use.

## Use Cases

- **Ham Radio Operators**: Encode or decode messages for Morse code communication.
- **Students and Educators**: Learn Morse code for educational purposes.
- **Cryptography Enthusiasts**: Work with Morse code as part of puzzles or challenges.
- **General Users**: Explore Morse code encoding for fun or experimentation.

## How to Use

1. Enter your text or Morse code in the **Input** field.
2. Select one of the following options:
   - **Text to Morse Code**: Converts plain text into Morse code.
   - **Morse Code to Text**: Converts Morse code into plain text.
3. View the result in the **Output** field.
4. Use the **Copy Output to Clipboard** button to copy the result for further use.

## Example Usage

### Input:

**Text:**

```
HELLO WORLD
```

**Morse Code:**

```
.... . .-.. .-.. --- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -..
```

### Text to Morse Code:

- **Input**: `HELLO WORLD`
- **Output**: `.... . .-.. .-.. --- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -..`

### Morse Code to Text:

- **Input**: `.... . .-.. .-.. --- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -..`
- **Output**: `HELLO WORLD`

## Supported Characters

- **Alphabets**: A-Z (case insensitive)
- **Numbers**: 0-9
- **Space**: Represented as `/` in Morse code
- **Unsupported Characters**: Ignored in both encoding and decoding.

## Why Use This Tool?

The **Text to Morse Code Tool** simplifies the process of working with Morse code. It is perfect for educational, professional, and recreational use, offering an intuitive interface for quick and accurate conversions.
